# AutomationFramework - 3Browser

In-house tool/framework developed for HP UFT 12.00 by me and approved by Pratik at L&T Infotech to automate any business process workflow on the internet using 3 most commonly used browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and IE)

Developed various modules as flexible robust functions that can be used to perform operations on any browser like (buttonClick, extractWebLink, selectCheckBox)

Framework built on MVC concept. The view is unique for each automated business process/flow whereas the model is specific to the web and controller is related to data controlling the interaction of view and model
